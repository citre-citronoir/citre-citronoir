### Hi, I' am Citre-Citronoir

I'm a second-year Computer Science student currently exploring a mix of systems programming, game development, and user interface design.
My current tools and interests include:
- **Languages:** C, C++, Rust (learning)
- **Areas of Interest:** Game development, systems programming, GUI/UI design
- **Tools:** CLion, IntelliJ, Zed, macOS M4

I split my time between university coursework and personal coding projects.
Right now, I’m experimenting with Rust, and learning how systems and games are built from the ground up.

Outside of programming, I enjoy photography. It helps me think visually, which I find useful when working on UI and design-related projects.
I also look forward to building a photo distribution platform for clients.

Check out my pinned repositories to see what I’m working on.
